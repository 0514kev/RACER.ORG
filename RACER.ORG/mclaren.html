                    Hey everyone, I just joined the forum and I'm super interested in the McLaren 570S.  Some people call it the "baby McLaren" but that horsepower doesn't seem very babyish!  Those dihedral doors are killer too.
                    
                    Can current 570S owners tell me what it's really like to own one?  Daily driver material, weekend warrior, or somewhere in between?  Also, any tips for someone considering buying a 570S?
                    
                    </p>

                <p>Hey everyone, I'm looking at getting a new McLaren GT and I'm torn. On one hand, it looks incredible and has mind-blowing performance. But on the other hand, is it too much car for daily driving?

                    Those of you who own a McLaren GT, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Do you use it as a daily driver? How does it handle errands and commutes? Or is it more of a weekend track car?
                    
                    Throw in any tips or tricks you've learned along the way too!</p>
